## <a name="html0">Duckett HTML Introductions</a>
 People Access the web through many different mediums.<br>
 This can range from browsers, web servers, devices and screen readers.<br> 
 Web Servers are computers that remain connected to the internet. They make <br>
 sure they send webapges out to devices that request them.
 
 Screen Readers: <br>
 - *Programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. <br>
  They are commonly used by peoplewith visual impairments.<br>*
 
 > 1.When you connect to the web,<br>
 you do so via an Internet Service<br>
 Provider (ISP). You type a <br>
 domain name or web address<br>
 into your browser to visit a site;<br>
 for example: google.com,<br>
 bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.<br>
 
>2.Your computer contacts a<br>
 network of servers called<br>
 Domain Name System (DNS)<br>
 servers. These act like phone<br>
 books; they tell your computer<br>
 the IP address associated with<br>
 the requested domain name.<br>

>3.The unique number that the<br>
DNS server returns to your<br>
computer allows your browser<br>
to contact the web server<br>
that hosts the website you<br>
requested. A web server is a<br>
computer that is constantly<br>
connected to the web, and is set<br>
up especially to send web pages<br>
to users.<br>

>4.The web server then sends the<br>
page you requested back to your<br>
web browser.<br>
    
   - DNS servers host the ip Addresses that all devices request.
   - They tell your device the specific ip address that is connected with the website
   > DNS servers are like the bouncers of websites. They let you have access to the club or in this case the website you requested.         

All websites use at their core HTMl and CSS it's just that larger Websites<br>
will use CMS systems(Content Managment Systems). Some examples would be like<br>
to make use of more complex techologies on the web server. This is all to futher<br>
the user experience of the website.
 - HTMl is constantly coming out with new version with each<br> 
  versions an improvement on the last


##  <a name="html1">Structure</a>

***Structure*** In HTML is created through the use of elements<br>
These are all the basic elements used on a webpage to create Structure
- **html**
- **Body**
- **h1**
- **h2**
- **P**

This diagram will help better understand the how these elements create<br>
structure to a webpage.

```<html>
      
    <body>
     
     <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
     
     <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
     the page. And if the page is a long one it might
     be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
    
     <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    
     <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
     you follow the structure of what is being written.
     There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
     headings).</p>
    
     <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    
     <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
   
    </body>
</html>

The Code above is an example of the most basic webpage structure.
at the top it starts off with a html element. An html element is basically
telling the computer that anything in between this section is one whole html code;
however if you look closely the html tag is surrounded by to angle brackets(<>).
Every element has an opening and closing tag.
```

>Tags act like containers. They tell you<br>
something about the information that lies<br>
between their opening and closing tags.<br>

```
<body>

THE GOOD STUFF

</body>


The body tag make sure that any code in between the opening a closing tags
show up inside the main window of the browser; basically without this tag you would 
have blank pages. Its like an essay without any words.
```

```
<h1>            <h2>


This tag just Creates a main header for your webpage. Its the first thing that should 
catch your eye on a page. 

```
```
<p>             </p>

This tag creates paragraphs on the page. This is useful when you have a lot of topics 
to cover.


```

```

<h2>            <h2>

h2 tags create sub headings. this is used to further sections parts of a webpage.

```

```

<title>           </title>

the title tags make sure that anything inbetween them shows up in the url of the webpage. as the the name
suggest it just names your webpage.
```
One thing to mention is that within these tags you can also have attributes. <br>
Attributes provide a little more information about what's inside a tag.<br>


```
<  p          lang    =                "en-us"   >   Paragraph in English</p>
            |_______|                |_________|
                |                         |
                V                         V
            Attribute Name          Attribute Value
```

Every Attribute must have a Name and Value. The Name is specifies what extra information<br>
is being added to the element. The Value is the Information of the Attribute.
 
## <a name="html2">Extra Markup</a>

We know that the internet is always changing and improving and with those<br>
improvments there different version of code that people use. <br>
===
how do we differenciate which version of Html we are using and communicate<br>
that to the computer?
