# How I explained REST to my brother

- ## Who is Roy Fielding?
    - one of the principle authors of the http specification and the
     originator of the representational state transfer architectural 
     style or REST.

- ## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
      - most of the techniques that developers used to get machines 
      to talk to each other didn't have the requirements to talk to 
      all the machines in the world instead machines could only talk 
      to a small group.

- ## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    - REST

- ## What does a GET do?
    - request data from a specified resource.

- ## What does a POST do?
    - adds something from one system to another

- ## What does PUT do?
    - replace something in another system

- ## What does PATCH do?
    - partial update on the system
