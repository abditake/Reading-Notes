# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- ## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
    - greater efficiency
    - Engaged collaboration
    - Learning from fellow students
    - Social skills
    - Job interview readiness
    - Work environment readiness
- ## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
    - greater efficiency 
    ### honestly the hardest part is getting started. so when I do pair programing it allows me to bounce off ideas with others and since they have other perspectives and other skills that smoothly get a part of a project to start.

- ## How does pair programming work?
    - someone is a driver and the other is a navigator. With these roles established you have one person who is the navigator who is only speaking and the driver who is the one actually doing the coding. This allows a fully collaborative effort someone gets muscle memory from typing the code and the other is challenged in interpreting what they want done in the code without them coding themselves.
