# Functional Programming Concepts

- ## What is functional programming?
      - style of building the architecture of your program.
- ## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
      - it is deterministic or returns the same result if given the same arguments
      - it does not cause any side effects

- ## What are the benefits of a pure function?
      - easier to test

- ## What is immutability?
      - something that is unchanging or can't change

- ## What is Referential transparency?
      - expressions in a program can be changed by its value without changing the results of the program.

# Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()


- ## What is a module?
      - a piece of code that has a certain functionality needed in the application  you are creating in node.js it's just like how react has separate components that do stuff.
- ## What does the word ‘require’ do?
      - it creates a global object
- ## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
      - we set the module with the functionality to a variable then require setting it to a global object.
- ## What do we have to do to make a module available?
      -module.export = (whatever module you want available)
