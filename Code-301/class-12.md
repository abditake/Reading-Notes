# Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick 

- ## Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
      - Because it has sensitive information.


- ## What is middleware?
      - code that runs when server gets request but before it gets passed to routes 

- ## What does `app.use(express.json())` do?
      - lets our server accept json as a body

- ## What does the `/:id` mean in a route?
      - gets a single route used with params

- ## What is the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?
      - put updates all the information of the route all at once instead of just the information that gets passed

- ## How do you make a default value in a schema?
      - 
- ## What does a `500 `error status code mean?

- ## What is the difference between a status `200` and a status `201`?
