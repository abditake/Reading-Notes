# Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API 


- ## Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
      - REST uses Http protocols to allow the user to Create, Read, Update, Delete.

- ## If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
      - setup basic server with express
      - create your router/
      - mount the router and add CRUD get/put/delete routes
      - create a schema 
      - now you should be able to add, remove, and get data from api.
