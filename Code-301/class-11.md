# nosql vs sql



- ## Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
| sqL      | nosql |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Table Based database     | Document, key-value. graph based database       |
|  non hierarchical data storage  | hierarchical data storage     |
|   ACID properties  |CAP theorem|
|complex query|non complex query|
|vertically scalable|horizontally scalable|
- ## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    - non hierarchial data 
- ## Give a real world example.
| country      | city |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| US     |   NewYork    |
|  France | Paris |

- ## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
      - hierarchial data 
- ## Give a real world example.
      - a family tree
- ## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
      - noSQL
- ## Which type of database is best for scalability?
      - noSql since you just add more servers rather than power.

# sql vs nosql 

- ## What does SQL stand for?
      - structure query language

- ## What is a relational database? 
      - a collection of data items with pre-determined relationship between them 

- ## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
      - schema
- ## What is a ‘schema’?
      - organization of structure for a database

- ## What is a NoSQL database?
      - mongodb which doesn't store data with relational tables but with documents.

- ## How does it work?
      - each document contains pairs of fields and values. the values can range from boolean, strings, to numbers.
- ## What is inside of a Mongo database?
      - mongodb stores data records as documents which are generated together as a collection

- ## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
      - mongodb because you are not forced to use a schema. as well as what information you put in each document.

- ## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
      - high memory usage for storage
