# Problem Domain Article
### `Problem domain`:  the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem.

- ## problem solving is hardest part of programing.
being presented a problem and trying to focus on the whole issue wont cut it sometimes<br>you need narrow down your focus to a particular problem. If the problem can be made easier to understand <br>then you can start working on your code with efficiency rather than being a little lost or adding unnecessary steps.



# Primitive values vs Object References Article
  - ### `object reference`: the variable contains a reference to the value not the value directly.
  - ### `primitive value`: the variable contains the value directly.
  - ### `mutable`: can be changed
  - ### `immutable`: cannot be changed
  All data types can be put into two categories: primitive values or object references.<br> Primitive values and object references behave differently and those difference are the reason javascript program run.<br>

# Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)
- ## `function declaration`: creates a function that can be called 
- ## `function expression`: creates an anonymous function that could be called;however its contents can be changed by code preceding it.
- ## `IFFE`: functions that are not given a name but run as the interpreter comes across them. 
- ## `local variable`:A variable that is created within a function. The contents of that variable cannot be accessed outside the function.
- ## `global variable`: a variable that is created outside a function. the contents of that variable can be used everywhere.

# Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)
- ## `Dom Tree`: a model that a browser creates sorting all the information that is within the html document.

- ## `object`: comma seperated key/value pairs
