# First Group
 - ## `Problem`:

 ### Rozovky was struggling with feeling safe in her group. It wasn't a space where she could relax speak freely but instead she felt like she was walking on egg-shells. 

 - ## `solution`:
 ### She removed herself from the envorinment entierly. She saw that peoples prides were clashing and the only option was to just leave.

# Second Group
- ## `Problem`:
### they had to create a space where everyone was welcome and felt safe enough to share ideas.

- ## `Solution`:

### Rozovsky mentions that the group would email each other funny jokes as well as start the meetings with a 10 miniute disccusion of their lives and other stuff. This just further built a good rapport within the group. Allowing for not only a productive team but a long-lasting one. 

 ## `Thoughts`:
 ### In this group Rozovsky noticed people the diversity of professions in the new group. This group dispite having different profession backgrounds not only got along great but they created a space where ideas flourished rather than being nipped in the bud. The big different between group one and two was that in group one the people had a space where they mutually respected each other and their ideas. In the reading it points out that they were coming up with some crazy ideas; if the first group wasn't so toxic to each other who knows what great ideas could have come out of there.
