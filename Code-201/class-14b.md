# Second Group
- ## `Problem`:
### they had to create a space where everyone was welcome and felt safe enough to share ideas.

- ## `Solution`:

### Rozovsky mentions that the group would email each other funny jokes as well as start the meetings with a 10 miniute disccusion of their lives and other stuff. This just further built a good rapport within the group. Allowing for not only a productive team but a long-lasting one. 

 ## `Thoughts`:
 ### In this group Rozovsky noticed people the diversity of professions in the new group. This group dispite having different profession backgrounds not only got along great but they created a space where ideas flourished rather than being nipped in the bud. The big different between group one and two was that in group one the people had a space where they mutually respected each other and their ideas. In the reading it points out that they were coming up with some crazy ideas; if the first group wasn't so toxic to each other who knows what great ideas could have come out of there. This translates to what Google learned about groups because of actions that Rozovsky experienced in group one that there was a correlation between people having a safe space to speak their thoughts/ideas and productivity. A group that had mutual respect for one another and appreciated everyone's input actually ends up creating a cohesive and efficient group. In the Reading this was called psychological safety. being able to understand one another's mood or life in general outside of work is crucial to becoming a cohesive group. There is no Guide to follow to get people to like you or like each other. As long as you create a space for people to speak to one another freely without judgment will you be able to create that bond. A good example of this is Sakaguchi. He saw his team wasn't opening up the way he expected so I started it. Sakaguchi as the leader of the team shared a personal part of his life and everyone else followed.
