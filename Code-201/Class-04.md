- `index`: the automatic assignment of numbers within an array.
- `operators`- allow the creation of single values from one or more values
- `arithmetic operator`: operators used to manipulate numbers

### Scripts are made up of a bunch statements. These statements add to each other like a recipe that has a very detailed instructions. Variables are used to store information that can be used within a script. Arrays store multiple pieces of related information. 

### - Javascript puts boolean values to numbers between 0-9

### when using expression they usually evaluate into a single value

### expressions rely on operators to calculate a value

- `ajax`: technique for loading data on page. it allows you to load a certain section of the page rather than reloading the entire page.
- `Data-formats`: types of code in page, html,xml,json.
    - you can load json from a different sites but it must be a trust source
    - json has double quotes on the key and no quotes on the value
### place script in the bottom of the page to make sure it loads better.

## Responses In Ajax:
  - `html`: Just change the data within html 
  - `xml`: is very similar to html but tag names are different. They describe the data they contain.
  - `json`: uses object literal notation

## Delcaring a function:
```
 keyword   function name
    |          |
function.sayHello(){
  document.write('Hello!'); ----> whats being done 
}
```
### functions store code. if different parts of your code need to repeats task you can just use a function.

## Calling a function

```
sayHello();

```

## functions that need information
``` 

                      parameters
                       ^
                       |
function getArea(width,height){
  return width * height;
}          |       |
        the parameters are like
        variables within the function
```
## Parameters vs arguments
- parameters inside the parenthetical width and height are like variables that can be changed. they are like values.
- arguments are variables that are outside the parenthesis that hold real numbers to put in place of width and height

# Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”

### `Pair programing`: is a way of programing to tackle a project or task. It works by using a driver and navigator. 
- A driver is someone who will be typing the code.
- A navigator is someone who will be handling the mechanics of the coding. 

### Pair programing works on listening, speaking, reading and writing. It also develops...
- Greater effiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness
