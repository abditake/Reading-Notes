# Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is all about conceptualizing the problem. In the model there should be attributes, behaviours, entities and limitations. This is shown in the reading using a object orientated model. Using a domain model you should be able to identify what's going on in a problem; that's only if it's written well.

- ## `instanciate`: to create an object or an instance of a given class.

- ## `new`: calls the constructor function to add to the object.

# Functions, Methods, and Objects

- ## `Browser Object Model`: contains obejects that represent current window or tab

- ## `Global Javascript Objects`: the global JS objects represents what JS language needs to create a model.

- ## `Document Object Modeling(DOM)`: uses objects to create a representation of current page.

- ## `object model`: group of objects that are related to things from the real world through which a program can examine and manipulate some parts of it.

- ## `index`: the system in which an array is stored. Every array has an index that starts from 0.
