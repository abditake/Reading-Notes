## [An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)
 
- ### Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
       - middleware is software that enables communication and data management between two applications. 
- ### Express the most popular __ __ ____.
       - node web framework
- ### Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
       - web frameworks describe themselves as opinionated and unopinionated. opinionated frameworks have more restrictions when it comes to solving problems outside their domain.Express which is a unopinionated framework tends to be more flexible and lets you brings components together much easier. You can insert any compatible middleware into the request handling in any order.  
- ### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
       - modularity allows you to not only have cleaner looking code increasing readability but it allows for efficient testing


## [What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)
- ### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
      - v16.13.2
 
 
 - ### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
      - npm i(install) jshint


 ## [What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

  - ### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
      - tests are important because it allows you catch bugs and errors in your code. Also testing allows you to find 
      maintain consistency when it comes to functionality and design. 
  - ### What are three expected benefits of testing
      - Reduction in defect rates
      - Improved design
      - Higher technical quality 
  - ### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
      - Running test for code that doesn't really matter
      - forgetting to run tests frequently
 
 ## [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

   - ### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
      - catch bugs
      - reduce conflict
      - integrating everyone's changes 

   - ### What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
        - Continuos delivery: develope to release at anytime
        - Continuos Deployment: deploy new features immediately 

   - ### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
        - github is like the central hub for everyone. it allows you to collaborate with others to maintain code 
        on a project as well as deploy the project.
