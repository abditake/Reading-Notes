# Hooks and Context example

- With regard to the React Context API, what does a “provider” do?
  - the provider passes state to a child component.
- With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a “consumer” role?
  - create a component that needs a state data from app can pass it that information by consuming the provider
- Specifically with Context, how are we “wrapping” components to achieve our goals?
  - we are wrapping the main app.js with the provider then passing that state in and wrapping where that state is used with a consumer.
