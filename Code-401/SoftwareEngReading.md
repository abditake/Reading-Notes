# Software Engineering Reading
<hr>

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
   
 - I feel like I bring a level of curiosity that doesn't inhibit growth. After 301 I didn't really know what I wanted to do since there was a big break. I had the privledge of working with a startup. This opportunity allowed me to learn new topics while also cultivating the skills I already learned at Code Fellows. 


## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Breaks: making sure that the first thing I do when I feel blocked that I completely remove myself from my computer and decompress. 

- Pen/paper: honestly I only picked this up a couple weeks ago but being able to write down a problem and work through it may sound tedious, but it can help a lot if you don't want to look at code and want a change of pace. 

### !!MOST CRUCIAL!! 
- Change Setting: I have a desktop so I do all my coding at my desk. When i really don't know how to solve a problem I just take my laptop and go somewhere else. This helps a lot without sacrificing time from deadlines.
