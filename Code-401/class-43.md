## Summary

- Next.js allows for server-side rendering as well as being able to create  your backend within your app. There is support for backend api that is handled by next.js itself. Honestly it is pretty seamless when it comes to building an app that does basic crud. This is the same for Gatsby however when it comes to certain cases Next.js would be a better option like for example if you are creating a multi-user website. Being able to quickly see the responses of web applications that have a large user base and editing ability is a must. Gatsby would need to build each time a user edits content on the page which isn't ideal since we want a response application. Personally I feel like next.js is easier and quicker to pick up but that was because I have a little more experience with it. Maybe in the future I will build with next.js
