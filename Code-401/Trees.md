# Implementation: Linked Lists



## Trees:

- ### A `Tree` like linked list is a node base data structure; however within a tree, each node can have multiple links to multiple nodes.

- # The following example below is a binary tree.

## Traversal:

- ## There are two options when trying to traverse a tree
    - Depth
    - Breadth 

    - ### depth is prioritizinn the height of the Tree. we do that in 3 ways.
        - pre-order root > left > right
        - in-order  left > root > right
        - post-order left > right > root

    - ### breadth is going through the tree by level and that is depicted below in alphabetical order.
