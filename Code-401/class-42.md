# Self-Driving Car

- The idea behind a self-driving car has always been to automate just another part of human life. Automation is what moves technology. The ability to create things that make other aspects of life either obsolete or just unnecessary. For example, you don't need to look at a real map just tell siri where you want to go and you got directions. The question of ethics comes into play when the technology you create can impact humanity. In the case of a self-driving cars the responsibility of driving is no longer on the person its completely up to the machine. Then this leads to how do we properly let a machine make a decision that is purely based on morality.
